### Context
This infrastructure decision addresses how we deploy, operate, and scale our systems. The decision is architecturally significant because it affects:

- System reliability and availability
- Operational efficiency and costs
- Team productivity and deployment processes
- Security and compliance requirements

The current infrastructure situation presents challenges:
- [Describe current infrastructure limitations]
- [Explain operational pain points or constraints]
- [Outline scalability or performance issues]
- [Detail business drivers for change]

### Proposed Design
**Infrastructure Architecture:**
- **Provider Selection**: [Cloud provider or hosting solution]
- **Region Strategy**: [Geographic distribution and data locality]
- **Network Architecture**: [VPC design, connectivity, and security zones]

**Compute and Container Strategy:**
- **Compute Instances**: [Instance types, autoscaling, and scheduling]
- **Container Platform**: [Kubernetes, ECS, or other container orchestration]
- **Serverless Components**: [Functions or managed services where applicable]

**Storage and Data Management:**
- **Databases**: [Managed database services vs. self-hosted]
- **Object Storage**: [File storage, backup, and archival strategies]
- **Data Replication**: [Cross-region replication and disaster recovery]

**Deployment and Operations:**
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: [Build, test, and deployment automation]
- **Infrastructure as Code**: [Terraform, CloudFormation, or other IaC]
- **Monitoring and Observability**: [Logging, metrics, and alerting]
- **Security Tools**: [Security scanning, compliance, and access management]

**Cost Management:**
- **Resource Optimization**: [Rightsizing, auto-scaling, and cost controls]
- **Budgeting and Reporting**: [Cost allocation and monitoring]
- **Reserved Resources**: [Long-term commitments and discounts]

### Considerations
**Alternative Infrastructure Options:**
1. **Alternative1 Option**
   - Description: [Alternative infrastructure approach]
   - Pros: [Cost, performance, or operational advantages]
   - Cons: [Limitations or trade-offs]
   - Decision: [Why this alternative was not chosen]

2. **Alternative2 Option**
   - Description: [Alternative infrastructure approach]
   - Pros: [Specific benefits of this approach]
   - Cons: [Drawbacks or incompatibilities]
   - Decision: [Why this alternative was not chosen]

**Operational Considerations:**
- **Team Skills**: [Required expertise and training needs]
- **Vendor Lock-in**: [Mitigation strategies for vendor dependence]
- **Compliance**: [Regulatory and security compliance requirements]
- **Support**: [Vendor support and SLA considerations]

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Availability Risks**: [Single points of failure and mitigation]
- **Security Risks**: [Threat vectors and security controls]
- **Cost Risks**: [Cost overruns and budget management]
- **Operational Risks**: [Human error and process failures]

**Migration Strategy:**
- **Phased Migration**: [Step-by-step migration plan]
- **Parallel Operations**: [Running old and new infrastructure simultaneously]
- **Rollback Strategy**: [Plan to revert if issues occur]
- **Data Migration**: [Strategy for moving data with minimal downtime]

### Decision
**Final Infrastructure Decision:**
- [Chosen infrastructure solution]
- [Primary reasons for this choice]

**Implementation Roadmap:**
- **Discovery Phase**: [Infrastructure setup and proof of concept]
- **Migration Phase**: [Gradual migration of services and data]
- **Optimization Phase**: [Performance tuning and cost optimization]
- **Stabilization Phase**: [Final adjustments and documentation]

**Infrastructure Specifications:**
- **Instance Types**: [Specific configurations and sizing]
- **Network Design**: [IP ranges, subnets, and security groups]
- **Backup Strategy**: [Backup schedules and retention policies]
- **Monitoring Setup**: [Metrics, alerts, and dashboards]

**Security and Compliance:**
- **Access Control**: [IAM policies and role-based access]
- **Data Encryption**: [Encryption at rest and in transit]
- **Audit Logging**: [Compliance and security monitoring]
- **Vulnerability Management**: [Security scanning and patch management]

**Performance and Reliability Targets:**
- **Availability**: [Uptime goals and SLAs]
- **Performance**: [Response time and throughput requirements]
- **Scalability**: [Scaling triggers and limits]
- **Disaster Recovery**: [RTO and RPO targets]

**Cost Management:**
- **Monthly Budget**: [Expected operational costs]
- **Cost Controls**: [Alerts and spending limits]
- **Optimization Strategy**: [Ongoing cost improvement plan]
- **Chargeback Model**: [Cost allocation to teams or services]

**Requirements Not Fully Satisfied:**
- [Any infrastructure requirements that cannot be met]
- [Compromises or workarounds required]
- [Future infrastructure needs to address gaps]
