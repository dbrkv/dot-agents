# ADR Decision Framework

## Identifying Architectural Decisions

### Characteristics of Architecturally Significant Decisions

1. **System Impact**
   - Affects multiple components or layers
   - Changes system boundaries or interfaces
   - Impacts system behavior or structure

2. **Longevity**
   - Difficult or expensive to change once implemented
   - Sets precedent for future decisions
   - Has long-term maintenance implications

3. **Stakeholder Impact**
   - Affects multiple teams or departments
   - Requires coordination across teams
   - Has business or operational consequences

4. **Constraints and Trade-offs**
   - Involves balancing competing requirements
   - Requires choosing between viable alternatives
   - Creates technical debt or operational constraints

## Decision Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Criteria
- **Performance**: Impact on system performance and scalability
- **Security**: Security implications and risk exposure
- **Maintainability**: Long-term code maintenance requirements
- **Compatibility**: Integration with existing systems
- **Reliability**: Impact on system reliability and uptime

### Business Criteria
- **Cost**: Implementation and operational costs
- **Time-to-market**: Development timeline impact
- **Risk**: Technical and business risk exposure
- **Compliance**: Regulatory and policy requirements
- **Team Skills**: Alignment with team capabilities

### Operational Criteria
- **Monitoring**: Observability and monitoring requirements
- **Deployment**: Complexity of deployment and rollout
- **Support**: Support and troubleshooting requirements
- **Training**: Team training and documentation needs

## Alternative Analysis Framework

### Option Generation
For each decision, identify at least 2-3 viable alternatives:

1. **Status Quo**: Continue with current approach
2. **Incremental**: Small improvements to existing solution
3. **Transformative**: Significant change to new approach
4. **Hybrid**: Combination of existing and new approaches

### Evaluation Matrix

Create an evaluation matrix for alternatives:

| Alternative | Cost | Performance | Security | Maintainability | Time-to-market | Risk |
|-------------|------|-------------|----------|----------------|----------------|------|
| Option A | High | High | Medium | Medium | Slow | Low |
| Option B | Medium | Medium | High | High | Fast | Medium |
| Option C | Low | Low | Medium | Low | Fast | High |

### Decision Documentation

For each alternative considered:

1. **Description**: Brief overview of the approach
2. **Pros**: Advantages and benefits
3. **Cons**: Disadvantages and trade-offs
4. **Requirements**: What would need to change
5. **Risks**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies

## Consensus Building

### Stakeholder Identification
- **Technical stakeholders**: Architects, senior developers, DevOps
- **Business stakeholders**: Product managers, business analysts
- **Operational stakeholders**: SREs, support teams, security teams

### Review Process
1. **Initial Draft**: Create preliminary ADR with analysis
2. **Technical Review**: Get feedback from technical stakeholders
3. **Business Review**: Validate business implications
4. **Final Review**: Address concerns and finalize decision

### Conflict Resolution
When stakeholders disagree:
- Document all perspectives clearly
- Identify trade-offs and implications
- Consider pilot implementations or prototypes
- Escalate to appropriate decision-maker if needed
